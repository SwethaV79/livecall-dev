Give exactly 3 short and meaningful response suggestions the agent can use immediately. Focus on empathy, clarity, and next steps. Keep them polite and helpful.

Format:
Response 1: [Polite, empathetic response acknowledging the issue and offering a clear next step/action.]
Response 2: [Alternative phrasing or approach, perhaps focusing more on reassurance or a slightly different action.]
Response 3: [A third option, potentially offering to gather more specific information, setting expectations on timing, or confirming understanding.]

Only return the 3 responses. No explanations or extra text.
